# DESIGN.md — the dashboard design rules

> This file owns **how the page looks and talks**. It states the rules that hold today; where an
> old habit conflicts with it, this file wins. A rule changes only once the owner has confirmed
> it, and the story of how each one came about — the dates, the measurements, what was there
> before — is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). The product the rules serve is
> [`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md).

## 1. Brand and language

- Title: **Jade Toad · `<owner>`**, the owner from `findata/register/profile.json`, never typed
  into the markup. In the sidebar it is the product name, **Jade Toad**, with the owner's name in
  small type beneath it.
- Interface language: **English throughout** — labels, buttons, hints, empty states, every page.
- Seven fixed spending categories, in English: Grocery / Subscription / Dining / Shopping /
  Transport / Entertainment / Other. The category name *is* the definition; never mix languages
  in it.
- **Every word that reaches the page is English.** A field in `findata/` that gets rendered is
  written in English; reasoning in another language goes in a `zh_`-prefixed field the page never
  reads.

## 2. Visual style

- **White cards on a pale ground**: page `#f9f9f7`, cards `#fcfcfb` with a 10px radius and a
  hairline border.
- **Small grey uppercase labels**: every card title is 10.5px, letter-spaced, uppercase, grey.
- **Big numbers**: a statistic is bold, tabular numerals, 23px or more.
- Typeface: the system sans (system-ui / Segoe UI). No serifs, nothing decorative.
- **Light theme only**: the page stays on a white ground whatever the system is set to.
- Month and year switching use **pill selectors**, the selected one black on white.
- **Compact**: card padding 12/15px, grid gap 10px, list rows 3–5.5px apart. Density first, but
  the line height stays readable.

## 3. Colour

- The category palette is a dataviz-validated 7-slot set, colour-blind safe in light mode:
  Grocery `#2a78d6` blue / Dining `#eb6834` orange / Subscription `#1baf7a` teal /
  Shopping `#eda100` yellow / Transport `#e87ba4` pink / Entertainment `#008300` green /
  Other `#4a3aa7` purple.
- **Colour follows the category, permanently. It is never reassigned by rank or by size.**
- **Income is one blue family** (Payroll `#1c5cab` / Rent `#5598e7` / Gift `#9ec5f4`), so income
  and spending read as two domains.
- **The plan's parts do not use the category palette**: Invest blue `#2a78d6` / Everyday orange
  `--c-dining` / Big buys yellow `--c-shopping` / Travel purple `--c-other` / Unallocated
  `--pill`; committed payments in `--muted`. Home's net-worth rows use the same semantic set.
- Anything semantic — up or down, good or bad — carries **colour *and* a symbol or arrow**.
  Colour alone is never the signal.

## 4. Page structure

- **One self-contained HTML file**, no external dependencies.
- **Desktop only**: `body` is `min-width:1120px; max-width:1760px`, with no narrow-screen
  `@media` block. **What widens is the charts and the wide tables, not everything**:
  - Stat cards and long text are capped (§5d); charts and wide tables are not.
  - ⚠ **A chart is `width:100%; height:auto`, never a fixed pixel height.** With a `viewBox`,
    `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"` and a fixed height, the drawing scales to its height
    and a wider window only adds white space beside it. `check_render.py` measures the painted
    width, not the box.
- **One left sidebar** (`aside.side`, 210px, sticky) beside `main.main`, rendered from the `NAV`
  constant. Home sits above the sections under no heading.
  - **A new page is one entry in `NAV` plus one `<section data-pg="key" hidden>`**, nothing
    else; `setPage()` is driven entirely by `NAV`.
  - **Records is a secondary group**: closed near the foot of the sidebar, opened by clicking its
    heading or by landing on one of its pages; while closed, its heading carries the strongest
    dot inside.
  - **The Glossary is on its own at the foot**, below Records and above the version, under no
    heading: it is a reference for reading the page, not a record.
  - **Dots**: `pageFlags()` hangs a 6px dot on a sidebar entry when its page has something on
    it — amber `#c98500` = look at this, red `#d03b3b` = a rule is broken or something is due.
    A new rule is wired into it.
  - The month pills appear only on `PILL_PAGES`, the year pills only on `YEAR_PAGES`.
  - The foot of the sidebar carries the tool version (`VERSION`) in muted 10.5px. MAJOR.MINOR:
    polish moves the minor, a change of shape moves the major.
- **One page, one question, one kind of time**: a page follows the month cursor, the year cursor
  or no time at all, never half of each; a thing is judged in one place, and Home only
  summarises.

<!-- LINT:PAGES pages=19 sections=5 -->
- **The pages**: 19 pages under 5 sidebar sections. **Lint rule S4 checks this table against
  `NAV`**, so changing the navigation means changing this table too — and the page count, the
  sidebar list and the minimum width stated in `README.md`, and every path the README hands the
  reader:
  | Section | Pages |
  |---|---|
  | — | Home (what needs you today, net worth in one card) |
  | Spending | This month · Year · Subscriptions |
  | Income | Income · Investment income |
  | Investing | Portfolio · Performance · Holdings · Rules |
  | Plan | Budget · FIRE · Drawdown & care · Spending baseline |
  | Records | To do · Updates · Accounts · Statements |
  | — | Glossary, at the foot of the sidebar |

### Home

- **Follows no time**: in neither `PILL_PAGES` nor `YEAR_PAGES`. Home answers *where do I stand
  now*; everything by month lives in Spending and Income.
- **What needs you today**, at the top: one row per thing to do, worst first — a rule broken, a
  date this week, a statement not filed, questions waiting, a task due within two weeks (the rest
  as one count), the allowance overspent, a fund short, spending drifting from the planning
  figure. The page name in grey uppercase, ✗/⚠/● status, the line, a › arrow; the whole row opens
  that page. With nothing to do it is one ✓ line. Every word is computed.
- **Four stat cards**, one per section: **Portfolio** (with the band status), **FIRE progress**
  (with the on-track year), **Invested in \<month\>** (pay-yourself-first, from the broker's
  record), **Free to spend** (the allowance today).
- **Net worth in one card, cut both ways at once**: one row per `role`, cash split by where it
  is — For FIRE / Set aside / Cash / Cash in \<abroad\> / Owed to you / Other assets (only for
  things that are not money). Each row's bar is as long as its share and coloured by `reach`
  (Spendable today / Taxed to take out / Promised to a goal / Lent out / In property / Held
  abroad); each `NWPARTS` row carries `by`, its reach split, rounded per piece and settled on the
  largest so the pieces sum to the row. Then total assets, less what you owe, and what is
  reachable today. A row appears only when the register has an item with that value. **Both
  cuts total `NW_GLOBAL`**, and rebuild.py refuses to build otherwise.
- The reach colours layer by **the cost of taking money out**, not by an age it unlocks: a
  Canadian RRSP is not locked, it is taxed.

### Spending

- **This month** — the month on the cursor, all of it: **Free to spend** (the headline: the
  allowance less this month's everyday spending, no categories, a track bar with an even-pace
  marker for the current month only); three stat cards (spent, biggest category, against a usual
  month); **Where the paycheque went** (the plan as flows, the allowance fanning out into that
  month's categories — refunds a source coming in, an overspend a second source from the fund
  that covers it, so every band is its real size and the total is Free to spend's); the category
  list and the line-by-line of the chosen category; **Big buys in \<month\>** on a card of its
  own.
- **Year** — the year pills, the yearly stat cards, "What stands out", the year by category, the
  monthly stacked chart, and **Inside the allowance, month by month** (everyday spending against
  today's allowance, the overspend in red, the open month faded).
- **Subscriptions** follows no time.
- No transactions page: a month's purchases are reached through a category on This month.

### Income

- **Follows the year only**: Income / Spent / Kept, the year by source — Investment carries its
  explanation, since it never reaches chequing — a line for what a borrower paid back, which is
  never income, and the months by source.

### Investing

- **The headline number is Portfolio**, money that is actually invested: the `grow` accounts. It
  is the group's only denominator; dry powder is measured on its home-currency part, and holdings
  in other currencies are listed separately.
- **Portfolio**: the stat cards, the three ways the portfolio splits, and the exchange-rate card
  that goes with the by-currency split.
- **Performance**: *Against \<benchmark\>* — the same money bought into the fund `rules.json`
  `benchmark` names, on the days it actually went in, drawn as that fund's daily line against the
  growth accounts' snapshots, dashed marks where money moved; three stat cards (your growth
  accounts, the same money in the fund, the difference); under a year of history, a note that it
  is too short to judge. Then *What you put in, and what the market added*.
- **Holdings**: every position, by role or by account; the Accounts column is always visible.
  A fund held in another currency shows that amount beside its home-currency value.
- **Rules**: every investing rule on one page. The high-level rules (`rules.json` `principles`)
  as they stand today, each with its detailed rules under it (`notes`, filed by `under`) and,
  under each of those, the dates to look at it again — a checkpoint belongs to the rule whose
  name carries a ticker the date mentions. What fits nowhere is listed last.
- Money held in another currency is not a page: its accounts are a card on **Accounts**, its
  funds are rows in **Holdings**.

### Plan

- **Budget** follows no time: the plan and the funds, no category caps.
  - **How each paycheque is split**: one stacked bar cutting take-home into the committed
    payments (one segment each) / Invest / Everyday / Big buys / Travel / Unallocated, with one
    line per part beneath it. Take-home, Invest and Everyday are sums of `funds.json`
    `plan.flows`, derived at load; Unallocated is what nothing names and stays where the
    paycheque landed.
  - Invest, Everyday and Big buys can be edited on the page (`.bud-edit[data-pk]`, kept in the
    URL hash and localStorage, never written back). Parts that add to more than take-home get a
    `noteBox`.
  - **The funds**: a goal fund with its bar and deadline; a fund with no goal with its opening
    amount, contributions, draw-downs and the largest purchase it covers today.
- **FIRE** answers *when*: the stat cards, the progress bar, the trajectory, and *If you stopped
  adding today* — the age today's money reaches the target alone, with the year and the return
  assumed.
  - **The trajectory**: the portfolio under today's contribution at three real returns, drawn to
    the target's dashed line, each curve stopping where it arrives, the legend giving
    "X.X years · month year". A money y-axis on nice steps; **the x-axis is calendar years
    anchored at `plan.json` `retirement.anchorYear`**, so it does not drift across a new year.
    The real snapshots are a black line with dots, first in the legend as Actual; the projections
    continue from the current month.
- **Drawdown & care** answers *does it last*: a headline sentence; two sliders (the age you stop
  contributing, the age you start drawing); a three-colour line on an **age** x-axis to 95 (blue
  contributing, green compounding alone, amber drawing down); a list of the portfolio at
  drawdown, the yearly withdrawal, its share and how long it lasts. Then *Would it have lasted?* —
  the same drawdown replayed through every whole stretch of real years since 1928 (`RET_HIST`,
  the portfolio's mix today, real returns): three stats (lasted to the end, worst start or
  closest call, the middle case), one bar per start year (green up = what is left, red down = how
  early it ran out), and a note that this is American history and the stretches overlap. Only
  the years of taking money out are replayed; the first day's pot is the steady path's.
- **Spending baseline**: the planning figure against what is really spent, with a 12-month bar
  chart, the months in the median highlighted, the median a red dashed line.

### Records

- **To do**: everything waiting for you, counted once — three stat cards (waiting, longest open,
  settled), then **To confirm** (every item an import could not settle, from
  `findata/history/decisions.json`, each with what was assumed meanwhile and the statement it
  came from), **Worth a second look**, **Open tasks** (dated first) and **Settled**. The header
  counts the questions only, and says "questions".
- **Updates**: where an update leaves its trace — three stat cards (last update, files on record,
  updates on file), then one card per update from `findata/history/imports.json`: what changed
  (label, from, to), what was noticed, what was decided without asking, what you were asked.
  **The story of an update lives here and nowhere else; every other page shows a status computed
  today.**
- **Accounts**: one row per place money sits, grouped by institution, the institution row giving
  its net position (credit cards negative, currencies never added together); a **home-currency
  total on the last row** — one of the two places currencies are added (§7), so its explanation
  states the rate and its date and how many accounts without a balance were left out, and it
  reconciles against the header's net worth (⚠ when it does not). Money held abroad is a card of
  its own ("Held in \<currency\>", hidden when there is none). Below, a card of what is missing,
  why, and how to fix it. The source is `findata/register/accounts.json`, **a register, not a
  second set of books**.
- **Statements**: the filing grid (§5c), and every source's date.

### Glossary

- At the foot of the sidebar, in no group: every finance term and every coined word (§5b′),
  finance terms first, grouped by letter.

## 5. Interaction

- Affordances are **shown, not explained**. Clickability is carried by pill states, hover
  backgrounds, and highlighting or dimming; an "everything" state is an All pill, never a "click
  again to show all".
- Charts have hover tooltips (dark bubble, white text), **one fact per line** — break with
  `<br>`, never string them on `·`.
- Legends isolate a single category on click: the selection is highlighted and the rest dim.
- **Explanations** (§5b′): a term with a dotted underline shows its dictionary entry on hover
  and opens the Glossary on click; a tappable number shows its sum. Both use one floating light
  card, clamped to the viewport, closed by clicking away or Esc.
- **On a page not yet moved to §5b′**, a definition is a 14px grey circled `?` after a card label
  or section title: hover or focus shows it, click toggles it. It states the measure itself —
  what is counted, what is not, the denominator — in one or two sentences, never a paragraph, and
  never explains an interaction.

## 5a. The top of the page, and the page header

- `body` has **38px** of top margin, 24px sides, 72px bottom; the sidebar is sticky at
  `top:38px`. Content never touches the top of the window.
- **Every page has a `.pghead`**, a 1px rule below it and `margin-bottom:20px`:
  - Left: an **eyebrow** (its section, 10.5px uppercase grey) and the **title at 25px**. No
    line of description under it.
  - Right: **Net worth**, on every page, a tappable sum, and under it **two dates, nothing
    else** — *Complete to* (the oldest of every required source's newest statement: the day all
    accounts are in up to) and *Updated* (the last update). Clicking them opens Statements. What
    is missing or waiting is said once, on To do and Statements.
  - **The two rules line up**: the sidebar wordmark and `.pghead` share `--headh:92px` and are
    both fixed-height with a bottom border, so both rules land on the same y on every page.
    Change the variable, never one side of it.
- The top of the sidebar holds only the coin mark and **Jade Toad** with the owner's name
  beneath (it clicks back to Home): flat colour, no gradients or shadows. No data date there —
  freshness belongs to Statements and the sidebar dots.
- **A number in the page header is not repeated in the page**: no page has a Net worth card.
- **Checks never appear on the page.** A page whose checks fail is not built.

## 5b. How copy is written

- ❌ **Never string facts on `·`.** ✅ `·` only between **parallel nouns** — a list of account
  names, a list of tiers — never between sentences.
- **One fact per line**: several data points are label-left / value-right rows (`metaList()`,
  `.meta`), not squeezed into a sentence.
- **Sentences are written as sentences**, with a subject and a full stop:
  `You are 34% of the way to $800,000, on track for Jun 2036.` — not
  `34% of $800,000 · base case (5%) Jun 2036`.
- **Warnings use `noteBox()`** (pale yellow with a `!`), and only for something that needs
  action.
- Plain words over jargon: `after refunds`, not `net of refunds`. A term the page keeps gets a
  Glossary entry.

**The page talks about your money, never about itself.** Lint **S8** scans the page code, not
the owner's own prose in the data:

1. **No first person.** The page never says "I": `Last received`, not `Newest I have`.
2. **Conclusions and actions, not provenance.** How a number was made goes in its sum or on
   Updates, never in a card.
3. **No rule numbers, file names, constant names or account IDs on screen.** A rule is called by
   what it means (`set aside`, not `rule 2`); an account by its name in `accounts.json`.
4. **A status is a status; a report is a report.** A rule on the Investing pages is one line
   computed today, ✓ or how far off. What an update noticed lives on Updates.
5. **A warning ends with what you can do.** `Not filed yet — the Sep 5 statement is ready to
   download.`
6. **Numbers about your money, not the pipeline.** Never `10 of 12 sources fresh`; instead
   `Chequing and savings are older than a month`.
7. **No lecturing.** No `worth knowing`, no `read this as`, no `that is X, not Y`. Your own
   principle may be shown, in one sentence, marked as yours.

The prose fields of `imports.json`, `decisions.json`, `plan.json` and `rules.json` reach the page
too, and the import writes them to the same rules (update-dashboard, Step 7).

## 5b′. Words on a card

A card carries at most three lines of text, and each has one job. Anything that does none of
these jobs is deleted, not shortened.

| line | job | rule |
|---|---|---|
| **label** | names the thing | a noun phrase of at most four words: `Net worth`, `Free to spend`. No verb, no sentence, no colon, no "your". |
| **value** | answers it | one number with its unit; `$838 of $1,300` is still one number. |
| **status** | the one fact the value cannot show | optional; at most seven words, one fact, no `·`, never a restatement of the label, never where a number came from. `On track for May 2039`, `Both transfers landed`. |

- **Explanations are never on the card.** A word that needs one is a **term**: dotted underline,
  hover for its entry, click for the Glossary page. A number that needs one is **tappable**:
  hover or tap it for how yours is worked out. A `?` is what is left on pages not yet moved over.
- **A term's entry is a dictionary entry**, the same for anyone: the word, its part of speech,
  one sentence, a formula where there is one, an example in round numbers, *see also*. Never the
  owner's numbers, never a name in another language. Words the page coined (`Set aside`, `Held
  abroad`) get an entry too, saying what they mean on this page — and it does not look like a
  dictionary entry: no part of speech, a gold rule down its side, headed *A word on this page*.
- **A number's explanation is a sum**: the parts as label / value rows, a total line only when
  they add up, then one line of what is in it or left out. It is where the owner's own
  descriptions in `plan.json` appear.
- **One name per thing, everywhere.** The Glossary is the authority: a word that is in it is
  spelled that way on every page (`Set aside`, never `Earmarked`).
- **A summary is a row, not a warning.**
- **Money is written one way**: `$1,300`, `−$61.02` (a real minus, before the dollar sign, never
  `$-61.02`); a date as `Oct 25`.
- **No instructions and no provenance in the text.** Not "Click a category to read it on the
  right", not "Projected from each subscription's own rhythm since your newest statement".
- **No subtitles**, on a card or under a page title.

## 5c. The filing grid

- The first card on Statements is **Filed each month**: one row per source going down, twelve
  months across, a mark when it has been filed.
- Three marks, their meanings in a list below rather than beside the cells:
  - **Filled black dot** = filed for that month
  - **Hollow amber ring** = due, and never arrived
  - **Small grey dot** = not owed yet — the account did not exist that month (`from`), or its
    statement has not closed
- **"Due" is judged by each source's own closing day** (`documents[]` in the register), not by
  the calendar month; a source with no statement uses `IMPORT_DAY`. The current month shows as
  missing only once its closing day has passed.
- The current month's column has a deeper background (`td.now`); the year pills are derived from
  `SUBMITTED`, never written down.
- The "Months in" column gives the count filed, with an amber "missing N" only when something
  is missing.

## 5d. Measured constraints

Each of these is checked by `check_design.py`.

- **Contrast**: `--muted` is `#75736d` (4.62:1 on a card). It carries the 10.5–11.5px label
  text, so recompute the contrast whenever a grey changes.
- **Line width**: long text is capped so a line stays 60–90 characters — `.meta` 720px, `.say`
  820px, `.note-box` 900px, an alert line 880px, sliders 560px.
- **A card is not drawn far outside its content**: a card holding only one capped list gets
  `.tight` (780px).
- **Stat cards are flex**, `flex:1 1 190px; max-width:340px`, never grid `auto-fit` with a
  fixed maximum, which lays its tracks at the maximum and wraps a fourth card.
- **Every page fills roughly a screen** (about 520px of content or more). A page that falls
  short gets content that answers a question it already raises — never padding, and never a
  merge with another page.

## 5e. Motion — two things only

- **A 120ms fade and 4px rise on page change**, `ease-out`, so a change of page is seen without
  reading the title.
- **Pure CSS**: `section[data-pg]:not([hidden]){animation:pageIn .12s ease-out}`. Toggling
  `hidden` replays it by itself, once per page change — never on a month switch or a slider drag,
  which a class added in JS would also trigger.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` turns motion off globally.** An accessibility floor, not an
  option. (Lint L2 forbids only width-based `@media`.)
- **Not done**: numbers that count up (the eye reads the false values on the way), donuts that
  spin in, any looping animation, anything over 500ms.
- **The test**: motion **expresses a change**; it never **performs an entrance**. A curve
  answering a slider live is the first kind.

## 5f. Accumulating years

File size is not the constraint: ten years of ledgers is well under a megabyte and the page still
opens instantly, so data is never split or moved out of the page because there is more of it.
What breaks is **how much fits on one screen**.

- **① The month axis is bounded.** Any chart drawn by month, any selector listing months, gets
  an array **filtered by year** (`MONTHS_IN(viewYear)`) or a **tail window** (`.slice(-N)`).
  Iterating `MONTHS` directly is never allowed.
  - The shape is **year as container, month as cursor**: one row of year pills, always twelve
    month pills (the empty ones `disabled`). The filing grid is the model.
  - `ymLabel()` already appends a short year for a month outside the current year (`Jun ’25`):
    never append it again. `ymFull()` gives "Jun 2026".
- **② A rolling statistic states its window and never means "all of history".** A reference
  value — "typical", a median — takes a tail window (`CAT_WINDOW` closed months) and **says that
  window on screen** ("vs the last 5 closed months"), with the real count when there are fewer.
  The gates compose: `covEnd` first (only months where every card has closed), then the window.

## 6. Restraint in copy

- **No footer disclaimer**, and no long redundant explanatory sentences.
- Explanatory text appears only where it is needed, within one line, in small grey type.

## 7. Principles for presenting data

- **The view starts at a year the owner chooses**; earlier history stays in `findata/` but does
  not enter it.
- Every source is labelled with its own as-of date. Amounts are kept per currency, home
  currency first, and never mixed into a total. **Two exceptions, both explicit conversions
  carrying their rate**: the header Net worth (`NW_GLOBAL`) and the home-currency total at the
  foot of the Accounts table. Adding currencies anywhere else is a bug.
- Refunds and negative amounts are shown as green negatives.
- Restraint in labelling chart values: totals on top of bars, amounts in the legend — never a
  number stacked on every data point.
