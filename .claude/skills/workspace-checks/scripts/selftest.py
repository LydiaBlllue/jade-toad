"""Break things on purpose, and check the linters notice.

WHY. The linters are the bottom layer of this workspace: everything above them is prose someone
has to read and follow, and they are the only part that is enforced. Nothing was watching THEM.
On 2026-09-08 that cost two bugs in one afternoon, both silent:

  · check_design' S4 rule walked a hardcoded "skills/" folder to resolve bare filenames. The
    skills moved to .claude/skills/ and the rule started failing every path it was meant to check.
  · hook.py found the workspace by counting "..", so one extra directory level made ROOT point at
    .claude/. It linted a folder with no data in it, reported three ledgers "missing", exited 0,
    and went on saying everything passed.

The second is the one that matters: a checker that has stopped checking and still says OK is worse
than no checker. So each case below plants a specific fault in a COPY of the workspace and asserts
that a specific rule fires. The copy matters -- the manual version of this ran against live files
with backups, one mistake away from being the fault it was testing for.
